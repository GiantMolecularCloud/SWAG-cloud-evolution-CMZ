## Abstract

The Survey of Water and Ammonia in the Galactic Center (SWAG) covers the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way at frequencies between 21.2 and 25.4 GHz obtained at the Australia Telescope Compact Array at ∼0.9 pc spatial and ∼2.0 km/s spectral resolution. In this paper, we present data on the inner ∼250 pc (1.°4) between Sgr C and Sgr B2. We focus on the hyperfine structure of the metastable ammonia inversion lines (J, K) = (1, 1)-(6, 6) to derive column density, kinematics, opacity, and kinetic gas temperature. In the CMZ molecular clouds, we find typical line widths of 8-16 km/s and extended regions of optically thick (τ > 1) emission. Two components in kinetic temperature are detected at 25-50 K and 60-100 K, both being significantly hotter than the dust temperatures throughout the CMZ. We discuss the physical state of the CMZ gas as traced by ammonia in the context of the orbital model by Kruijssen et al. that interprets the observed distribution as a stream of molecular clouds following an open eccentric orbit. This allows us to statistically investigate the time dependencies of gas temperature, column density, and line width. We find heating rates between ∼50 and ∼100 K/Myr along the stream orbit. No strong signs of time dependence are found for column density or line width. These quantities are likely dominated by cloud-to-cloud variations. Our results qualitatively match the predictions of the current model of tidal triggering of cloud collapse, orbital kinematics, and the observation of an evolutionary sequence of increasing star formation activity with orbital phase.


## Disclaimer

Note that is this should not be understood as a pipeline to automatically reproduce the results of this publication.
Changes during the analysis and interactive steps may prevent these scripts from running unsupervised.
Instead, they should allow to understand technical aspects of the analysis and retrace it, e.g. to test consistency with future analyses.
Scripts may make intransparent use of convenience functions, such as my [python_helpers](https://github.com/GiantMolecularCloud/python_helpers).
These may be loaded in a python startup file which is not apparent from the scripts.
Also, software versions may not be given. For example, some code may break when run in python3 because it was developed in python2 back then. This applies equivalently for other software packages.
